# MonstieHuntieHax
This is a WIP memory editor for Monstie Huntie Stories 2 for Nintendo Switch.
Check the [releases page](https://github.com/Glazelf/MonstieHuntieHax/releases) for releases and the [issues page](https://github.com/Glazelf/MonstieHuntieHax/issues) for general progress.

## Risks
There is no easy way for us to test the ban risks of using this tool, especially online.  
For the first few months of the game being released we will have no proper indication of the risks either so use this tool fully at your own risk. If you do discover anything relevant to the risks of using this, please contact us either through [Discord](https://discord.gg/5NsYYuvm7D) or [a discussion](https://github.com/Glazelf/MonstieHuntieHax/discussions) so we can document it for future reference.  
"Luckily" people are probably selling really poorly made hacks online so we can just look at them and see if they get people banned or not. :)  

## Support
